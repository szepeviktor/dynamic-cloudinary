# Dynamic Cloundary

__Automatically serve all your images optimized from the cloud.__

This WordPress plugin proxies all images and videos on a page through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). It uses [Cloudinary auto-upload](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images#auto_upload_remote_resources) functionality so Cloudinary uploads and serves images on the fly. This means you don't have to upload anything to Cloudinary. Everything just works out of the box. Cloudinary also provides a powerful transformation API so you can modify and optimize images on the fly.

## Install

1. Upload and active the WordPress plugin. Make sure you run `composer install`.
2. Configure the plugin in the WordPress admin in\ `Tools > Dynamic Cloudinary`
